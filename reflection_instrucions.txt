**1. Project Overview** [~1 paragraph]
What data source(s) did you use and what technique(s) did you use analyze/process them? What did you hope to learn/create?

**2. Implementation** [~1-2 paragraphs]
Describe your implementation at a system architecture level. You should NOT walk through your code line by line, or explain every function (we can get that from your docstrings). Instead, talk about the major components, algorithms, data structures and how they fit together. You should also discuss at least one design decision where you had to choose between multiple alternatives, and explain why you made the choice you did.

**3. Results** [~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples]
Present what you accomplished:

- If you did some text analysis, what interesting things did you find? Graphs or other visualizations may be very useful here for showing your results.
- If you created a program that does something interesting (e.g. a Markov text synthesizer), be sure to provide a few interesting examples of the program's output.

**4. Reflection** [~1 paragraph]
From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for testing? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?
